# hello-world
A new programmer is born and he proclaims Hello World!

I am the pragmatic idealist. I am a dreamer to the core but to the outside world I am an executor. Through trials and tribulations and journeys of self-discovery across many industries and ventures, I learned how to turn my dreams to reality. These next few years I will embark on new journey to master the skills I need to further enhance my ability to bring goodness to this world. To end unecessary suffering and to create as much good in the shortest amount of time. To create order from chaos. This is my mission for myself and to the world.

Hello World!
